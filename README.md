The goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines on the game board. You do this by rotating and moving falling blocks, called "tetrominoes," to fit them together without leaving gaps.

How It Works
The Game Board:

The board is a vertical rectangle with 10 columns and 20 rows.
Tetrominoes fall from the top, and you have to arrange them as they descend.
Tetrominoes:

There are seven different shapes: S, Z, I, O, J, L, and T.
Each shape is made up of four squares and has its unique color.
Gameplay:

You control the falling tetrominoes. You can move them left or right and rotate them to fit together.
The objective is to create complete horizontal lines without gaps. When you fill a line, it disappears, and you earn points.
Scoring:

You score points every time you clear a line.
If you clear multiple lines at once, you earn more points.
Increasing Difficulty:

As you clear lines and score points, the game speeds up, making it more challenging to place the tetrominoes.
Losing the Game:

The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the board and there's no space for new ones to fall.
Starting and Playing:

The game begins with a welcome screen. Press any key to start playing.
During the game, you'll see your current score and the highest score you've achieved so far.
Ending:

When you lose, a "You Lost!" message appears. You can try again to beat your high score.
The game is about quick thinking and strategic placement, trying to fit the shapes together efficiently as the speed increases. It's a fun way to challenge your spatial awareness and reaction time!
